The encoding process described earlier is not practical, since it assumes that num-
bers of unlimited precision can be stored in Low and High. The decoding process de-
scribed on page 111 (“The decoder then eliminates the effect of the S from the code by
subtracting. . . and dividing . . . ”) is simple in principle but also impractical. The code,
which is a single number, is normally long and may also be very long. A 1 Mbyte file
may be encoded into, say, a 500 Kbyte one that consists of a single number. Dividing a
500 Kbyte number is complex and slow.
